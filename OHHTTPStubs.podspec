                    |A class to stub network requests easily:
                    |
                    | * Test your apps with fake network data (stubbed from file)
                    | * You can also customize your response headers and status code
                    | * Use customized stubs depending on the requests
                    | * Use custom response time to simulate slow network.
                    | * This works with any request (HTTP, HTTPS, or any protocol) sent using
                    |   the iOS URL Loading System (NSURLConnection, NSURLSession, AFNetworking, â€¦)
                    | * This is really useful in unit testing, when you need to test network features
                    |   but don't want to hit the real network and fake some response data instead.
                    | * Has useful convenience methods to stub JSON content or fixture from a file
                    | * Compatible with Swift
