 @param handler The request handler block to add to the stubs list. This block takes as parameters:
    - a NSURLRequest for which the stub is called, to determine the appropriate response to return
    - a boolean as a parameter to tell if this block is only called for checking we want to stub or not (in this case, you should return quickly)
      or for the actual stubbing (in this case you should return the actual OHHTTPStubsResponse to use)
